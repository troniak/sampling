# ASSIGNMENT: Sampling and Reproducibility in Python

Read the blog post [Contact tracing can give a biased sample of COVID-19 cases](https://andrewwhitby.com/2020/11/24/contact-tracing-biased/) by Andrew Whitby to understand the context and motivation behind the simulation model we will be examining.

Examine the code in `whitby_covid_tracing.py`. Identify all stages at which sampling is occurring in the model. Describe in words the sampling procedure, referencing the functions used, sample size, sampling frame, any underlying distributions involved, and how these relate to the procedure outlined in the blog post.

Run the Python script file called whitby_covid_tracing.py as is and compare the results to the graphs in the original blog post. Does this code appear to reproduce the graphs from the original blog post?

Modify the number of repetitions in the simulation to 100 (from the original 1000). Run the script multiple times and observe the outputted graphs. Comment on the reproducibility of the results.

Alter the code so that it is reproducible. Describe the changes you made to the code and how they affected the reproducibility of the script file. The output does not need to match Whitbyâ€™s original blogpost/graphs, it just needs to produce the same output when run multiple times

```
All stages of sampling are occurring in the model: (1) initial event assignment of 1000 events using a binomial distribution (2) uniform random infection sampling ATTACK_RATE percentage of the population (3) uniform random primary contact trace sampling TRACE_SUCCESS percentage of infected individuals at random (4) secondary contact tracing conditionally sampling all infected individuals from an event with SECONDARY_TRACE_THRESHOLD or more infected individuals.

No, the current implementation isn't showing the same degree of overestimation of wedding cases that the blog post described and illustrated.

It produces slightly different results each time I run it. I modified the code to make it reproducible by setting the random seed to a fixed value.
